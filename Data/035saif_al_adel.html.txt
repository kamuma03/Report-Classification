Al-Adl is an al-Qa’ida senior leader and a member of AQ’s leadership council, the “majlis al-shura.” Al-Adl also heads al-Qa’ida’s military committee.

Al-Adl was indicted and charged by a federal grand jury in November 1998 for his role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi Kenya. The attacks killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others.

He was a lieutenant colonel in the Egyptian Special Forces until his arrest in 1987 with thousands of other anti-government militants following an assassination attempt on Egypt’s interior minister

As early as 1990, al-Adl and other al-Qa’ida operatives provided military and intelligence training in various countries, including Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Sudan, for the use of al-Qa’ida and its affiliated groups, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad.

In 1992 and 1993, he and Abdullah provided military training to al-Qa’ida operatives as well as Somali tribesmen who fought against U.S. forces in Mogadishu during Operation Restore Hope.

He has charged by a federal grand jury in November 1998 for his alleged role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya.

After the bombings, al-Adl moved to southeastern Iran and lived under the protection of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. In April 2003, Iranian authorities placed him, Abdullah, and other al-Qa’ida leaders under house arrest.

In September 2015, al-Adl and four other senior al-Qa’ida leaders were released from Iranian custody in exchange for an Iranian diplomat kidnapped by al-Qa’ida in Yemen.

Al-Adl also was a senior lieutenant to Abu Musab al Zarqawi, founder of al-Qa’ida in Iraq which later became ISIS.
